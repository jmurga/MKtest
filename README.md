# mktest
asymptotic MK calculations accounting for background selection and weak adaptation
 
 
 Included in this repository are the scripts we used to simulate, infer parameters, and evaluate our method in 
 Uricchio, Petrov & Enard (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/427633v2)
 
 Most of the scripts (especially those that we used to perform ABC) are currently set up to run on the Stanford cluster.  
 We are working on software that will be more general use.
